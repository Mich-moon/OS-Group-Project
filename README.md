# OS-Group-Project
This project serves as an animated simulation of the operating system concept - Process Scheduling Algorithms. The aim of this project is to show how an OS works, in a visual manner with proper pacing that allows the viewer to follow what is happening, and therby see/visualize how the written and theoretical OS material really works. 

## Funtionality
Simulation of the following process scheduling algorithms:
 - Shortest Job Next
 - First Come, First Serve
 - Priority
 - Round Robin
 
   
## Installation
Requirements:
 - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 
   
## Running
  - Download or clone the project
  - Open a command prompt terminal and enter the project folder
    - example ```cd OS-Group-Project-main```
  - create a virtual envirnment 
    ```bash 
    $ python -m venv venv (you may need to use python3 instead)
    ```
  - activate virtual environment 
    ```bash 
    $ source venv/bin/activate (or .\venv\Scripts\activate on Windows)
    ```
  - install packages in the requirements file
    ```bash 
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt 
    ```
  - Run the app
    ```bash
    $ python project.py
    ```
